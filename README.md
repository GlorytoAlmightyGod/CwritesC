IT IS TAUGHT ONCE,
IT KNOWS AT ONCE,
IT KEEPS FIGURING OUT THE IMPLICATIONS ON EXISTING MEMORY.

    how the memory is to be changed,
    it needs to learn for itself depending on the problems-environment?

memory itself is FORM+NAME.
for memory i get to use object oriented programming.
how can memory be a form?
    a form is meaningless BUT it has certain meaning.
    how is this meaning being given in the memory?

how does focusing work?

    there are usefull truths that can be deduced concerning a form.
            IF these truths are present in a generic case,
            THEN _that_ is the case.
        **_this_** runs depending on certain things. 

for example :


it sees one pair of lines.
parallel lines.

then it itself has to know that all translation and rotational images will be parallel lines.

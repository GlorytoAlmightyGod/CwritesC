problem is that which alleviates suffering upon resolving.
fix -if applied in Reality- resolves the problem.
in a certain way, fix is an inversion of the problem.

to know of THIS = THIS IS THAT in Reality.

in the given problems-environment,
    (do i know how to come to know of IT?)
    coming to know of :-

        that which the self is.
            that which the self is NOT.
        
        that which is with respect to the self.(Reality)
            that which is NOT with respect to the self.
        
        that which is at play for the self in Reality.
            that which is NOT at play for the self in Reality.
        
        that which is worth knowing.
            that which is NOT worth knowing.

        that which is significant.
            that which is NOT significant.
        
        that which can change.
            that which can NOT change.

        that which the self does want to be done.
            that which the self does NOT want to be done.

        that which the self can do.
            that which the self can NOT do.
        
        that which the self can access.
            that which the self can NOT access.
            (how the self can change THIS.)
            
        that which the self does do.
            that which the self does NOT do.
        



    in order to resolve the problem.



seeking for a cetain thing.
perception of [IF this; THEN that.](here is the why!)



























    how the memory is to be changed,
    it needs to learn for itself depending on the problems-environment?

memory itself is FORM+NAME.
for memory i get to use object oriented programming.
how can memory be a form?(CAD models!!)
    a form is meaningless BUT it has certain meaning.
    how is this meaning being given in the memory?

how does focusing work?
    well-informed search seems like intelligence.
    the search <= what the self can do + what the self wants to be done.

    perception of usefull truths concerning a form.
            IF these truths are present in a generic case,
            THEN _that_ is the case. some action step taken.
        **_this_** runs depending on certain things.

for example :


it sees one pair of lines.
parallel lines.

then it itself has to know that all translation and rotational images will be parallel lines.

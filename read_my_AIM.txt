understanding the WHY is the key.
we build it in a way that what we call as context is very very very flexible in memory.
full of properties of things and what the self can and can not do.(perception also)
using functions as well as loops for the same work-item.

hidden IF-THEN are used to create texts of unhidden IF-THEN. how wonderfull...
use recursion to my heart's content!!!

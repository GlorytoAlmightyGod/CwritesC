in the search of how to win;
nothing seems real if examined carefully;
everything seems real if conveniently ignored?
2 unreal things(existing in name alone) give the self an impression that both are real because of
 the impact they seem to have on each other.

1 object(thing) can have many forms, depending on how i get to see it.

the way in which IT is changing(recorded in) the memory,
    is also a part of the memory.

memory itself is FORM+NAME.
for memory i get to use object oriented programming.
how can memory be a form?(CAD models!!)
    a form is meaningless BUT it has certain meaning.
    how is this meaning being given in the memory?

the minute nature of each problems-environment is very weird. making everything seem unreal.

how does focusing work?
    well-informed search seems like intelligence.
    the search <= what the self can do + what the self wants to be done.

    perception of usefull truths concerning a form.
            IF these truths are present in a generic case,
            THEN _that_ is the case. some action step taken.
        **_this_** runs depending on certain things.

for example :


it sees one pair of lines.
parallel lines.

then it itself has to know that all translation and rotational images will be parallel lines.
